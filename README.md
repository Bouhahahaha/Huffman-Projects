# Huffman-Projects

This project was done by five l2 students in 2020. They are ColinBezombes, GuillaumeLesage, MatéoDominguez, JulesCastagnet, ValentinThiébaut. The goal of this Huffman project was to understand it the and try to make it our own. During this project we learned many method
of working in a programming group such as working with github. Our working method fitted really well with the application as our group planned on giving each member of our group 
seperate parts of the project. This meant that we were enabled us to change the code individually and to update it for the group which made working on the project much easier.
